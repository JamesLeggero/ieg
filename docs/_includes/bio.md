## About Me

Hi, I’m Ruthie Dreyer — a dual-licensed Special Education and English Language Arts teacher with nine years of experience in New York City high schools. I hold a Master’s in English Education from NYU Steinhardt and am passionate about helping students grow both academically and socially.

Since welcoming my son, Billy, in July 2024, I’ve shifted from classroom teaching to working one-on-one with students. My approach focuses on building lifelong skills — from organization and time management to self-advocacy and confidence — so students can work more independently and feel successful in school.

I work with both neurodivergent and neurotypical learners, offering:
- A commitment to culturally responsive education.
- Support with educational and social-emotional goals
- Reading and writing skill development
- College essay coaching (including from my experience in Lab’s college office)
- Regents ELA preparation
- Literacy intervention using REWARDS and Phonics programs

<!-- During the pandemic, I created a series of Reading Support Videos to teach metacognition and deep textual analysis — one of which earned me a student nomination for a shoutout from 74million.org. You can explore these on my site to see my teaching style in action. -->

If you’re looking for a tutor who will meet your child where they are, tailor instruction to their needs, and help them grow in both skill and confidence, I’d love to work with you.
